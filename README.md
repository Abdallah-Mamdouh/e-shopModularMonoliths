🚀 e-Shop Modular Monolith (.NET 8)
📌 Overview

This repository implements a production-oriented backend system built with .NET 8 and ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, designed to demonstrate modern backend architecture patterns and scalable system design principles.

The focus of this project is architecture, modularity, and real-world backend design, rather than feature completeness.

It showcases how to design and implement a maintainable, extensible system using modern architectural patterns:

Modular Monolith Architecture (Modulith)
Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)
Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Outbox Pattern for reliable messaging
Event-driven communication with RabbitMQ & MassTransit
Secure APIs using Keycloak (OAuth2 / OpenID Connect / JWT Bearer)
Cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, caching, error handling)

🏗 Architecture Overview
Core Principles
Pattern	Description
Modular Monolith	Single deployable unit with strict module boundaries
Vertical Slice Architecture	Feature-based organization instead of layered architecture
Domain-Driven Design (DDD)	Business-driven domain modeling
CQRS	Separation of read/write models for scalability
Outbox Pattern	Reliable event publishing with transactional consistency

🔄 Module Communication
Synchronous Communication: In-process calls via module APIs
Asynchronous Communication: Event-driven messaging using RabbitMQ & MassTransit

🔐 Security
Keycloak as Identity Provider
OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
JWT Bearer Token authentication
